./src/mpack/conv.c	330	warn	V1048 The 'rv.lo' variable was assigned the same value.
./src/mpack/mpack_core.c	238	err	V610 Undefined behavior. Check the shift operator '<<'. The right operand is negative ('(t - 0xdb)' = [-27..4]).

./src/mpack/object.c	137	warn	V1086 A call of the 'memcpy' function will lead to underflow of the buffer 'dst'.
./src/mpack/object.c	137	warn	V1086 A call of the 'memcpy' function will lead to underflow of the buffer 'src'.
./src/mpack/rpc.c	248	warn	V1086 A call of the 'memcpy' function will lead to underflow of the buffer 'dst'.
./src/mpack/rpc.c	248	warn	V1086 A call of the 'memcpy' function will lead to underflow of the buffer 'src'.
./src/nvim/drawline.c	2211	warn	V560 A part of conditional expression is always true: eol_hl_off == 0.

./src/nvim/eval/typval.c	1262	warn	V547 Expression 'info.item_compare_func_err' is always false.
./src/nvim/ex_getln.c	2894	err	V595 The 'colored_ccline->cmdbuff' pointer was utilized before it was verified against nullptr. Check lines: 2894, 2900.
./src/nvim/fileio.c	5200	warn	V557 Array overrun is possible. The value of 'strlen(tmp) - strlen(user)' index could reach 18446744073709551615.
./src/nvim/highlight.c	329	warn	V547 Expression '!wp->w_ns_hl_attr' is always false.
./src/nvim/marktree.c	160	warn	V1086 A call of the 'memcpy' function will lead to underflow of the buffer 'z->key'.
./src/nvim/msgpack_rpc/unpacker.c	402	err	V501 There are identical sub-expressions to the left and to the right of the '==' operator: MPACK_TOKEN_STR == MPACK_TOKEN_STR

./src/nvim/spell.c	2929	err	V781 The value of the 'i' index is checked after it was used. Perhaps there is a mistake in program logic.
./src/nvim/spellsuggest.c	1155	warn	V1086 A call of the 'memset' function will lead to underflow of the buffer 'sp'.
